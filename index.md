## Redistricting  *(Brief)*

- __Goal(s):__ Visualize how related dataset(s) show the ‘face’ of some electoral districts; unearth stories of district attributes, like economic and/or judicial power.

- __Primary Audience:__ Described as folks who spend time researching or are well informed on the topic of redistricting. They are at minimum readers or podcast listeners of Five Thirty Eight or equivalent media outlets This visualization is not necessarily tuned for the general public, and is not designed to provide a visual solution to the gerrymandering problem the general public would likely want from a visualization on this topic. Their characteristics might affect my editorial and design decisions by enabling me to highlight singular districts as story examples without providing a broader context of districts as a full picture, because this audience can envision how a few examples can illustrate how the data overlaid might look or play out in other districts with their broad understanding of districting. Labels may be shorter, or definitions can be skipped or not listed as centrally to the visual, e.g. as a footnote.

- __Approach:__ Show economic power balances. See how I can overlay political donations over districts, aligned by years. Another option is to show what political parties state judges align with to the extent possible, in order to illustrate how that might impact a state level judge run non-politician commission to set districts, a solution some folks have inquired to Five Thirty Eight about through questions addressed in their podcasts, and which some other countries use.

- __Proposed format and delivery channel(s):__ Possibly a zoomed in area map, e.g. to a single district showing overlay data areas such as zip codes or other relevant format the donation is organized as (full donor address I believe is public). Judicial representation could be with quickly recognizable gavel symbol. Show enough background, or greyed out portion of state district is part of to be immediately recognizable. Alternately pan out and do a weighted map where the state polygons are sized based on the ‘power’ the data shows. Will it be easy enough to tie donation candidate recipients to a political party?
